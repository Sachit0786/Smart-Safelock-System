# Smart-Safelock-System
This is the verilog implementation of a finite state machine(FSM) that uses a three digit hexadecimal password to open the lock of a safe or enter the freeze state if the password is incorrect for the number of times greater than the maximum allowable attempts. This system is verified and implemented using FPGA Technology on DE2I-150 FPGA board.
